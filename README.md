PhoneGap Demo Battery
=====================
Trying to figure out, why PhoneGap 2.9.0 / PhoneGap Build isn't able to read language settings?

Problem tested on four different devices and Android versions:

- Samsung Galaxy Nexus with Android 4.3 (previously Android 4.2.2),
- Sony Xperia E with Android 4.1.1,
- LG GT540 with Android 2.3.3 and CyanogenMod, 
- GSmart Rola G1317D with Android 2.2.2.

**None has gives positive result**! All of tested platforms failed to get current system language.
